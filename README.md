# Here is the MIEC Repo of HANLIN CAI (Lance)
My name is **Hanlin Cai**. I am a junior majoring in Automation at [Fuzhou University] (China) and Robotics and Intelligent Devices at [Maynooth University] (Ireland, Combined Degrees). I gain a CGPA of 3.79/4.00, ranking top 10% in my major. Recently, I am nominated for the 2021-2022 **China National Scholarship** (top 0.1%).🎊

Open-source projects are my favorite and I am so prond of these communities. And this [miec-club] Repo is where I keep track of my MIEC experience. You can learn RIDS & CSEE better by refering to my Repo, but **please do not directly copy my assignments, codes and any reports!**
